description: "A quick note on my new website"
---

My new personal website is written in Jekyll! I think it's much simpler than the one I had before where I wrote everything from scratch!

It draws heavily from [Mu-Ans site](https://muan.co/). I really like Mu-Ans eye for design and web development.
