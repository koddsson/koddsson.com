This is a specific thought after watching and reading a bunch on Tom Sacks. I discovered Tom after watching a bunch of Casey Niestat videos and learning that Casey used to work with Tom at his studio in New York.

Since then I've thought about my cooking and my cookbook and I really want to make a physical one. I want to make a cookbook to use in the kitchen. Spring notebook with nothing fancy on it.

Thinking about the cookbook I've gotten ahead of myself and thought about writing a intro to it. I think this is often my problem; over thinking. Realistically I'm making a cookbook so it's easy for me to whip up something good in the kitchen. It's not for anybody else. Tom even has a rule against this way of thinking; [Creativity is the enemy](https://ropac.net/exhibitions/547-tom-sachs-creativity-is-the-enemy/)

I should just write some recipes down so it's easy for me to follow them and it's easy to add or change stuff. If I want an intro to it or change some recipes I should leave space for it to be added later. A few pages can be left at the beginning, a spacious margin for edits. Pages could even be glued in if needed!

I should stop trying to make the thing perfect before I've even started. Just make the thing first!
