# Gift Ideas

Sometimes people want to buy me things and I feel like I'm terrible at coming up with ideas on the spot. Here's where I'll collect some ideas of gifts that I'd love to receive.

- [Shrigley Embroidered Pocket "We love fermentation" T-Shirt from Noma - €49,95](https://nomaprojects.com/products/we-love-fermentation-t-shirt?variant=41378907422925).
- [Noma 2.0: Vegetable, Forest, Ocean Gift Set - €105,95](https://nomaprojects.com/products/noma-2-0-gift-set?variant=41312659996877).
- [Any of the various garums, vinegars or sauces (so long it's vegan/vegetarian) from Noma](https://nomaprojects.com/collections).
- [Any of the Tom Sachs stuff from his website](https://store.tomsachs.com/).
- [Any of the Brumm Brumm prints from their website](https://brumm.is/collections/our-prints). I particularly like the Icelandic foods.
- ~[I love all these Icelandic maps](https://mapsoficeland.shop/product-category/iceland-maps/).~
  - I got this for Christmas 2025!
- Turns out Iceland is **cold** so I think I could use some wind/water/whatever proof trousers. [These are nice](https://www.66north.com/is/skalafell-bibs/p/W41254?color=910&size=XL).
- I'm a big Mac Miller fan and love all [his merch](https://shopuk.macmillerswebsite.com/).
- ~I make coffee out of a Hario V60 most mornings but it usually get's cold before I can drink it all. I really want to replace my glass Hario servers with [these insulated ones](https://kaffitar.is/collections/hario/products/hario-v60-hitakanna-svort) to keep them warm.~
  - I got this for my birthday 2025!
