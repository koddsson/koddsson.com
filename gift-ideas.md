# Gift Ideas

Sometimes people want to buy me things and I feel like I'm terrible at coming up with ideas on the spot. Here's where I'll collect some ideas of gifts that I'd love to receive.

- [Shrigley Embroidered Pocket "We love fermentation" T-Shirt from Noma - €49,95](https://nomaprojects.com/products/we-love-fermentation-t-shirt?variant=41378907422925).
- [Noma 2.0: Vegetable, Forest, Ocean Gift Set - €105,95](https://nomaprojects.com/products/noma-2-0-gift-set?variant=41312659996877).
- [Any of the various garums, vinegars or sauces (so long it's vegan/vegetarian) from Noma](https://nomaprojects.com/collections).
- [Any of the Tom Sachs stuff from his website](https://store.tomsachs.com/).
- [Any of the Brumm Brumm prints from their website](https://brumm.is/collections/our-prints). I particularly like the Icelandic foods.
- [I love all these Icelandic maps](https://mapsoficeland.shop/product-category/iceland-maps/).
- Turns out Iceland is **cold** so I think I could use some wind/water/whatever proof trousers. [These are nice](https://www.66north.com/is/skalafell-bibs/p/W41254?color=910&size=XL).
