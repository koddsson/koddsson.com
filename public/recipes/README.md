# recipies

Collection of some of the stuff I cook at home and think is delicious.

## TODO

- Make loading indicators
- Improve caching
- Fetch images from Instagram for recipes
- Fix name (it's recipes, not recipies)
- Set up a JSON schema
- Migrate old recipes to correspond to the schema
- Manually import recipes from HelloFresh
