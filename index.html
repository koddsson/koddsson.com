      <p>Hey! I'm Kristj치n and my pronouns are he/him. I like working with Web Platform features and hacking on small projects like this web site. You'll find some posts and notes here. I'm currently working at <a href="https://github.com/koddsson">GitHub</a> as a Web Systems Engineer and post recipies that I like to cook on <a href="http://koddsson.cooking">koddsson.cooking</a>.</p>

<p>I tooted a little git command joke on Fosstodon the other day.</p>
<p><toot-embed src="https://fosstodon.org/@koddsson/109958542284187610"></toot-embed></p>
<p>I imagine that git terminal users like me often mis-type the commands and I'm a fan of injecting humor into my daily life. The way I created the above screenshot is by creating a git alias. Normally you git alias different git commands but you can actually execute any command as a git alias by prepending the command with a exclamation.</p>
<pre class="language-sh"><code class="language-sh">$ <span class="token function">git</span> config <span class="token parameter variable">--get</span> alias.ranch<br><span class="token operator">!</span>imgcat ~/Downloads/cowbow-kitten.png</code></pre>
<p>Someone actually replied to my toot that I should alias common misspellings of commands as their right commands but I've already got <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_help_autocorrect"><code>help.autocorrect</code></a> set on my git config.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why it's not mentioned in the docs but I've got mine set to <code>-1</code> so that the autocorrect is executed immediately.</p>

<p>I recently came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0160IirdL4">this video</a> from The Browser Company that caught my attention. While the content of the video wasn't particularly interesting to me, the way it was made was.</p></p>
<p>If you are running macOS (or possibly on a different OS), you already have the tools you need to create a presentation. There's a built-in app called &quot;Screenshot&quot; that you can use for screen recording, and you can also use a web cam preview to show your face, just like the person in the video.</p>
<p>In the past, I've used a similar approach with a Codepen by feeding a webcam video stream directly to a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag and then opening the video in picture-in-picture mode to display it borderless while screen recording. It works really well and allows you to easily open files and websites in your presentation, providing additional context for the topics you're discussing. You probably don't need to get any special tools for this, as it's easy to do with the tools that are already available.</p>

<p>My new personal website is written in Jekyll! I think it's much simpler than the one I had before where I wrote everything from scratch!</p></p>
<p>It draws heavily from <a href="https://muan.co/">Mu-Ans site</a>. I really like Mu-Ans eye for design and web development.</p>
