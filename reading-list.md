I have a high standard for books I'll generally reccomend to other software engineering. I read a bunch of more other books but they might be just OK or more specific so I don't want to reccomend it.

I plan on updating this list over time

## Site Reliability Engineering

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27968891-site-reliability-engineering

Probably the origin of the term "Site Reliability Engineering". Useful to most software engineering and not just SREs.

## The Grug Brained Developer

https://grugbrain.dev/

A no-nonsense take on modern day software engineering with a focus on simplicity and how to handle communication with different stakeholders.

## Software Engineering at Google

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48816586-software-engineering-at-google

A great resource for software engineers based off learned lessons from Google. Pretty down-to earth suggestions with great rationals behind each one. Has suggestions on how to implement systems and solutions to your codebase.
